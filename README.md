# 🏥 AI Powered Predictions for Hospital Stay Lengths with Explainability

This project leverages **Machine Learning** and **Explainable AI (XAI)** to predict patient hospital stay durations using clinical data. The goal is to assist healthcare providers in optimizing resource allocation, enhancing patient care, and reducing operational costs.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Predictive Modeling**  
  Trains ML models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) to forecast the number of days a patient might stay in a hospital based on key features like age, diagnosis codes, comorbidities, and admission types.

- **Explainability**  
  Uses **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to offer feature-level interpretations, helping clinicians understand why a particular prediction was made.

- **Data Preprocessing**  
  Includes handling missing values, normalization, one-hot encoding, and feature selection to ensure high-quality input for the models.

- **Evaluation Metrics**  
  Models are evaluated with MAE, RMSE, and R² Score to guarantee reliability and clinical applicability.

- **Deployment (Optional)**  
  A web-based dashboard or API enables users to input patient data and view predictions along with interpretability plots.

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)  
- **SHAP** for explainability  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** for data visualization  
- **Flask / Streamlit** (optional) for web deployment
